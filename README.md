# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 
 A rock paper scissors game where you play against the computer

In prototyping phase to determine how to recognise what play the user has made
This attempt tries to use image subtraction and binary thresholding to mask out the user's hand
but this is a little flawed as it requires you to have a consistent background for the subtraction to work

Next we'll try finger tracking for more consistency as I want to be able to use any background
